# Classification of imbalanced data

In this project, I'm demonstrating how to use SMOTE library to syntesize the imbalanced class. 

I have applied different classification algorithms on the data before and after using SMOTE.

I have reported the F1 score, precision, and recall for various algrithms applied to the data.

The data is masked and consists of both categorical, and numerical data. Further, it has Nan, in both types of features which requires different strategies to deal with them.
